It gained’t cost you something, and this fashion, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and doubtlessly decide up the tab for anything your major insurance doesn’t cover. If you don't sign up for Part B if you're first eligible, you might have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>

The six months of retroactive benefits applies if you enroll in Medicare after sixty five. At that time it’s automatic and you may’t accept or reject it – it just happens. For example, when you enroll at 65 half of, you’ll get Medicare relationship again to sixty five.<p>

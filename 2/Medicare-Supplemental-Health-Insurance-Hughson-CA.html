<p>The Medicare Rights Center was not in a position to confirm that all ministries work this way, but it might be sensible so that you can consider that your ministry has such a requirement. Your review should include whether there's coverage for prescribed drugs. These usually are not coated by Parts A or B, but usually require a Part D drug plan from a private insurer. You would pay the complete payment for such providers, either by yourself or via private medical health insurance. Please observe the table is sorted by Star Rating , adopted by month-to-month premium and options links direct to the provider’s website.<p>

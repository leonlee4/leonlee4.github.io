<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans do not cover benefits like vision, dental, eyeglasses, hearing aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you want pharmaceuticals, you would need to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

Advantage plans are provided by private insurance firms and are required to cover everything you'd have with Original Medicare.<p>

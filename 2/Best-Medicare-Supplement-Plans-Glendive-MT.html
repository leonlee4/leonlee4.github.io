When very small employers join along with different employers in situations like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as a minimum of one of many employers has 20+ workers. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check together with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.

MA plans differ with respect to what benefits they supply, out-of-pocket costs corresponding to premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and whether or not they provide prescription drug coverage.

<p>The general enrollment interval for Original Medicare is from January 1 via March 31 of each year. Keep in thoughts that you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B if you didn't join whenever you have been first eligible. If you could have health coverage by way of current employment (either by way of your work or your partner’s employer), you may resolve to delay Medicare Part B enrollment. You ought to speak with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you understand how your current coverage works with Medicare and what the implications would be if you drop Medicare Part B.<p>

<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be applicable should you didn't join Medicare Part B if you had been first eligible.

In most cases, if you don’t join Medicare Part B if you’re first eligible, you’ll should pay a late enrollment penalty.

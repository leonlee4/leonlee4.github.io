In 2017, the average out-of-pocket restrict for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the same as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $4,313 in 2011 .

<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like vision, dental, eyeglasses, hearing aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you want prescribed drugs, you would need to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

<p>HMOs — These plans provide medical coverage and health care from a specific set of docs, specialists, and hospitals which are inside a plan's permitted community. Original Medicare includes Part A and Part B. Part A covers inpatient hospital companies, skilled nursing care facility expenses and hospice care. Part B, which covers some medical doctors' services, medical supplies, preventative care and outpatient care. One factor to find out about Original Medicare is that it doesn't pay for prescribed drugs.<p>

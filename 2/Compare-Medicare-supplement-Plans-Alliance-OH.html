It received’t cost you anything, and this fashion, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and potentially choose up the tab for something your main insurance doesn’t cover. If you don't sign up for Part B if you're first eligible, you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>The annual deductible for Part B will rise to $198, which is $13 greater than the $185 deductible in 2019. If you are on Medicare, the price of your coverage for physician's appointments and different outpatient services is about to rise.

<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B throughout your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to wait till the next General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 every year. You might then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you may have had Part B and did not enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% greater premium for each 12-month interval that you just were eligible for Medicare Part B however didn’t sign up for it.

<p>A late enrollment penalty could also be relevant should you didn't join Medicare Part B whenever you have been first eligible. Your month-to-month premium may be 10% higher for each 12-month period that you simply had been eligible, but didn’t enroll in Part B.

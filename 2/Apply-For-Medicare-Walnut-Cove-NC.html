These plans are often known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>You can replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare Prescription Drug plan during AEP without penalty.

<p>Medicare Part D is available as a stand-alone prescription drug plan via private insurance firms, and the month-to-month charge varies among insurers.

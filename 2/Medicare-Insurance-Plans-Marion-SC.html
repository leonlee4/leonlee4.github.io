<p>Advantage plans supply additional coverage like hearing services, prescription drug coverage, dental providers, and imaginative and prescient care. Medicare Advantage plans might prevent money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll want to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage.

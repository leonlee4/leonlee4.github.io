<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year if you don’t need to.

You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

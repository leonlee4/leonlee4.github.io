<p>The only exception is when you’re contributing to a health savings account and wish to continue doing so. Medicare enrollees aren't allowed to contribute to an HSA, even when they continue to have coverage underneath an employer’s HSA-qualified excessive-deductible health plan.

However, plan particulars can change yearly, so you might wish to compare your plan options for each to verify your health and prescription drug needs are covered by your plan for the following 12 months. This interval is also referred to as Fall Medicare Open Enrollment and the Annual Election Period .<p>

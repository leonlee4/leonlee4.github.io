You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

If you already collect Social Security income benefits or Railroad Retirement Benefits, you will automatically be enrolled in Medicare when you flip 65.<p>

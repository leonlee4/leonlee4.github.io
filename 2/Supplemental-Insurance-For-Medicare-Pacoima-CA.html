<p>You can apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan any time in the course of the year. The Special Enrollment Period allows you to change or add Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug coverage outdoors of AEP due to sure qualifying events. Some plans, like Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug plans, send info to members each fall that explains changes within the plan’s benefit coverage, prices, or service area for the following plan year.

As of 2019, Medicare Advantage plans have been allowed to cover a broader range of extra benefits, together with things like home health aides, medical transportation, and the set up of in-residence safety units. But comparatively few plans have started offering these benefits as of 2020.<p>

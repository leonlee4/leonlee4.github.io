If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% greater premium for each 12-month interval that you simply were eligible for Medicare Part B however didn’t sign up for it.

Generally, if an individual remains to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and may enroll later during a SEP.

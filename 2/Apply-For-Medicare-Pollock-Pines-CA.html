<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

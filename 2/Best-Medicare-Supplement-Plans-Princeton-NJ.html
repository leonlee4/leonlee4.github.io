Age 66 is now thought of Social Security’s “full retirement age,” which means the age when you'll be able to claim your full retirement benefits with out penalty. Some start to claim reduced benefits at age sixty two, whereas others wait till after full retirement age to claim greater benefits. You probably know the reply to this long before your 65th birthday.<p>
<p>Starting Medicare Part B at the right time can help ensure that you've got strong health coverage at the lowest cost to you.

Creditable coverage contains the insurance offered to you or your partner through work.<p>
<p>If you’re covered beneath a partner’s group health plan at an organization with 20 or extra staff, you do not need to join Medicare at 65.

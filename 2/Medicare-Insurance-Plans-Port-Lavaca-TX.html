<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.

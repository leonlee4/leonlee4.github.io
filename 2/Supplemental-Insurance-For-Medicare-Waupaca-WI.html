<p>The average premium for Medicare Advantage plans with built-in Part D coverage is about $36/month in 2020. Across all Medicare Advantage plans, the common premium in 2020 is about $23/month, and is predicted to lower to $21/month in 2021.

<p>These revenue limits apply in 2020, and are listed for inflation. There is not a donut gap when it comes to the utmost amount that enrollees could be charged when they fill prescriptions. But the donut hole still exists by way of how insurers design their coverage , how total drug prices are counted, and who covers the bulk of the price of the medicine (the drug plan versus the manufacturer; see Figure 4 right here).<p>

<h3>Tips for Choosing the Right Insurance Policy in Plymouth</h3>
<p>You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan if you’re first eligible for Medicare, or during the annual Medicare open enrollment interval within the fall . If you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B , you’re eligible to enroll in a Medigap plan to supplement your Medicare coverage. You’ll have a six-month guaranteed-concern window during which you'll be able to sign up for any Medigap plan out there in your area. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll need to undergo medical underwriting should you decide to apply for a Medigap plan after that window ends.

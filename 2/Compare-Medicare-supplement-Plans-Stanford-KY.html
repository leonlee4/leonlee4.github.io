You’ll have a six-month guaranteed-concern window during which you'll join any Medigap plan out there in your space. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll need to go through medical underwriting should you resolve to apply for a Medigap plan after that window ends.

You need to have both Part A and Part B to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Supplement plan. You don't should enroll in Part B instantly, because you'll be charged a premium. Just do not forget that when you select to attend to enroll in Part B, you will be charged a late enrollment penalty, and Part B coverage will cost you more. Understand timing and coverage options to get the place you have to go.<p>

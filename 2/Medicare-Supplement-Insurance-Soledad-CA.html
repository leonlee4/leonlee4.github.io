<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage via them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you simply sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>More than three million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Special Needs Plans .

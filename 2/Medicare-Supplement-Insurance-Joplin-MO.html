When very small employers join together with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as at least one of many employers has 20+ staff. But employers also can ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check with his group plan to see what their particular guidelines are.

<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.

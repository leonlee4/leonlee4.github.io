Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding associate plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).

Prior authorization is most often required for comparatively expensive providers, similar to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, however infrequently required for preventive companies. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can also require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B drugs, meaning that they're required to strive some specific medication before they receive approval to try different medication.

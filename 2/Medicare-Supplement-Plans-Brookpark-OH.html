<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, shall be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.

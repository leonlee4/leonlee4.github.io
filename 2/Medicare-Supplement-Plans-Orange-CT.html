<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

<p>Be positive to be conscious that when he does take Social Security, he might be enrolled in Part A, efficient six months retroactively. Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the yr, which may lead to penalties.

If you aren’t getting benefits from Social Security no less than 4 months before you turn sixty five, you'll want to sign up with Social Security to get Part A and Part B. I’ll be getting benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board a minimum of 4 months earlier than I turn sixty five. In most circumstances, it is dependent upon whether or not you’re getting Social Security benefits.<p>

<p>If you are not signing up for Medicare at 65 and currently have firm offered group coverage, are you required to verify this with Medicare?

<p>But these averages mask extensive regional and helpful variations. Just as the most important advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the main determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the dimensions of that protection.

If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your primary card for Medicare—you should still keep and use it everytime you want care. And, if you have a Medicare drug plan, be sure to hold that card as nicely.<p>

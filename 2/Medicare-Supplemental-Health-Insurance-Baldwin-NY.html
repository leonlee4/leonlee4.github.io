<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.

You might then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you could have had Part B and did not enroll.

<p>If you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, most Medicare providers are covered by way of the plan and aren’t paid for under Original Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans offer prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Advantage plans, the essential Medicare Part A and Part B benefits – besides hospice services – are routinely coated.

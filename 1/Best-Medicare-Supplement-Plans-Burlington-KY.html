<p>These earnings limits apply in 2020, and are indexed for inflation. There is now not a donut hole when it comes to the maximum quantity that enrollees can be charged once they fill prescriptions. But the donut hole still exists when it comes to how insurers design their coverage , how total drug costs are counted, and who covers the bulk of the price of the medicine (the drug plan versus the producer; see Figure 4 here).<p>
<p>Plan F was essentially the most comprehensive plan at that point, nevertheless it’s now not available to people who find themselves newly-eligible for Medicare.

<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

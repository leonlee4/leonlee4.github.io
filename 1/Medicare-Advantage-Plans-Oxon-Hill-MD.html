If you might be required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you just ship in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your present coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).

When very small employers join along with other employers in situations like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as a minimum of one of many employers has 20+ staff. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check with his group plan to see what their particular rules are. If you’re currently working full-time and he or she is covered by way of your plan, she may be able to safely delay enrolling in Medicare.<p>

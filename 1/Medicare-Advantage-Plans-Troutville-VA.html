<h3>Keys to Choosing the Right Individual Health Insurance Plan in Troutville</h3>
<p>In common, when you’re enrolled in Medicare, you don’t must take action to resume your coverage every year. This is true whether or not you might be in Original Medicare, a Medicare Advantage plan, or a Medicare prescription drug plan.

Your medical insurance could also be coated by a group medical insurance plan by way of your employer. You can enroll in Medicare at any time if you lose your group insurance.<p>
<p>If you didn't enroll in prescription drug coverage throughout IEP, you can join prescription drug coverage in the course of the Annual Election Period that runs yearly from October 15 to December 7.

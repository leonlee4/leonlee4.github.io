This comes with an employer request for info form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage through them because the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union legal guidelines mandating that you just join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw back” the amount it paid for your care when it finds out. At that time, you would want to enroll in Part B, however might no longer qualify for the SEP when you delayed enrolling for more than eight months.

When very small employers be part of along with different employers in situations like this, the plan will provide main coverage so long as at least one of many employers has 20+ employees.

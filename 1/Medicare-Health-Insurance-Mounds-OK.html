<p>Keep in thoughts that not all health insurance coverage is created equal in Mounds. Here are some scenarios under which you might have health coverage but nonetheless need to sign up for Medicare whenever you turn 65.<p>

You’ll also get a 3-month Special Election Period if your Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan terminates its contract with Medicare. This period starts two months earlier than the contract ends and runs an extra month after the contract ends. If Medicare terminates your plan’s contract, you'll have a Special Election Period that begins 1 month before the termination effective date and ends 2 months after the efficient date of the termination.

If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% larger premium for each 12-month interval that you simply have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it. You might should pay this greater premium for as long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be routinely enrolled. You can join or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration directly.<p>

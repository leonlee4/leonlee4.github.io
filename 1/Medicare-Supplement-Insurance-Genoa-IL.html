This comes with an employer request for information form often known as L564.

<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

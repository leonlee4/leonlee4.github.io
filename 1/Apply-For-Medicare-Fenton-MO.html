<p>It may also be important to know the implications for beneficiaries in both Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare, when it comes to prices, benefits, premiums, quality of care, affected person outcomes, and access to providers. After exceeding this catastrophic threshold, beneficiaries pay 5 % of the price of medication. Both stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans and MA-PDs have the flexibility to differ the price-sharing design of their Part D benefit; nevertheless, CMS limits the plans’ deductibles and in 2017 the deductible can not exceed $four hundred. Additionally, as previously mentioned, premiums differ throughout plan varieties and enrollment by plan type varies throughout states.

<p>Medicare will then pay a hundred% of your costs for as much as 60 days in a hospital or up to 20 days in a talented nursing facility.

<p>But 15 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are under 65, and have become eligible after receiving Social Security disability benefits for 2 years or being recognized with ALS or end-stage renal illness. During the primary yr a person is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, they will swap to Original Medicare and a Part D plan.

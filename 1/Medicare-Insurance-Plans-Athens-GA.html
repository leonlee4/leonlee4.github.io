You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.

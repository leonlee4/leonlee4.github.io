This comes with an employer request for info form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage by way of them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union legal guidelines mandating that you join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>If you don’t enroll in Part B, your insurer will “claw back” the amount it paid in your care when it finds out. At that time, you would need to enroll in Part B, however may now not qualify for the SEP when you delayed enrolling for more than 8 months. If you’re happy together with your current Medicare plan, you don’t must take any action.

Your coverage will end the first day of the month after Social Security will get your request. If you are underneath sixty five and receiving sure disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you will be routinely enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, after 24 months of disability benefits.<p>

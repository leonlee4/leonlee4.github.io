<p>People who aren’t but amassing Social Security, or aren’t eligible for Social Security Retirement, aren’t routinely enrolled into Medicare. Some individuals get Medicare Part A and Part B routinely and a few individuals want to enroll in them.<p>
<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans do not cover benefits like vision, dental, eyeglasses, listening to aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you want prescription drugs, you would have to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

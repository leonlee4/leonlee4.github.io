Prior authorization is most often required for relatively expensive providers, similar to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B medicine, but occasionally required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans also can require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B drugs, that means that they are required to try some specific drugs before they obtain approval to attempt other drugs.

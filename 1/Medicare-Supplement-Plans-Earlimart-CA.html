<p>If you are turning sixty five and have employer-based coverage via your personal job, you can delay signing up. Is the insurance via your work, or do you purchase it separately/individually? If sure, then you should contemplate signing up for Medicare or you would face Part B enrollment penalties, denied claims, or extra. I will flip 65 on July 6, 2020 so I will start Medicare on July 1, 2020. I will retire from my giant employer on June 30, 2020 and that will be the final day of my health coverage via my employer.<p>

<p>You can apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan any time through the year. The Special Enrollment Period enables you to change or add Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug coverage outdoors of AEP as a result of certain qualifying occasions. Some plans, like Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug plans, send information to members each fall that explains changes in the plan’s benefit coverage, costs, or service area for the next plan 12 months.

I will turn 65 on July 6, 2020 so I will start Medicare on July 1, 2020. I will retire from my giant employer on June 30, 2020 and that will be the last day of my health coverage through my employer.<p>
<h3>Keys to Choosing the Right Individual Health Insurance Plan in North Port</h3>

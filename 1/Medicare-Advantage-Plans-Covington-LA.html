<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months should you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.

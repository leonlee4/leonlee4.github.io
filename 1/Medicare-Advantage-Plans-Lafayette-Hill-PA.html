If you might be dissatisfied along with your coverage for next 12 months, make changes throughout Fall Open Enrollment.<p>
<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether and how it will pay in the event that they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B.

You can sign up for Medicare Part B at any time that you have coverage via current or energetic employment. Or you can join Medicare during the eight-month Special Enrollment Period that begins when your employer or union group coverage ends otherwise you stop working . If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you stop working, understand that this doesn’t count as coverage based on current employment; ensure you don’t wait until your COBRA benefits end to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>

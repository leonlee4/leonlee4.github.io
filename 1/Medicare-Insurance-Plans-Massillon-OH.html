If you drop a Medicare Advantage plan throughout AEP and do not enroll in another one, you will mechanically return to Original Medicare.Remember this would possibly imply you will lose drug coverage if it was included with your plan.<p>
<p>Medicare Advantage plans typically incorporate further benefits, including Part D coverage and extras such as dental and vision. And the plans do include a cap on out-of-pocket prices that may’t exceed $6,700 in 2020 , which Original Medicare doesn't have.

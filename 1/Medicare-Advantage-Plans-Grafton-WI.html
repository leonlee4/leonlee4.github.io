Only give your Medicare Number to docs, pharmacists, different health care providers, your insurers, or folks you trust to work with Medicare in your behalf. If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan , your Medicare Advantage Plan ID card is your major card for Medicare—you should nonetheless maintain and use it everytime you need care. And, in case you have a Medicare drug plan, be sure to keep that card as nicely.<p>

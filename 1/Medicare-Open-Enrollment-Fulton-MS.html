This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage by way of them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union legal guidelines mandating that you just sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

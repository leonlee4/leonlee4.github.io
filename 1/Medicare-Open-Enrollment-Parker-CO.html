<p>You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan whenever you’re first eligible for Medicare, or in the course of the annual Medicare open enrollment period in the fall . If you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B , you’re eligible to enroll in a Medigap plan to supplement your Medicare coverage. You’ll have a six-month guaranteed-problem window during which you'll sign up for any Medigap plan available in your area. In most states and most circumstances, you’ll have to undergo medical underwriting if you resolve to apply for a Medigap plan after that window ends.

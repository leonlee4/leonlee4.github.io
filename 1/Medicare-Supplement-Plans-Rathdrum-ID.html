<p>Some could pay a portion of out-of-community care, whereas others will cover solely docs and services that are in the HMO or PPO community.

If sure, then you should think about signing up for Medicare or you can face Part B enrollment penalties, denied claims, or extra. I will turn 65 on July 6, 2020 so I will start Medicare on July 1, 2020.

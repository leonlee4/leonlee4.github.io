Medicare MSA Plans combine a high deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a belief or custodial savings account (as defined and/or approved by the IRS).<p>
<p>You can apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan any time in the course of the year. The Special Enrollment Period lets you change or add Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug coverage outside of AEP because of certain qualifying occasions. Some plans, like Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug plans, ship data to members every fall that explains changes in the plan’s benefit coverage, costs, or service area for the subsequent plan 12 months.

<p>When you file for your personal retirement benefit, you'll receive an extra cost roughly equal to the quantity by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit.

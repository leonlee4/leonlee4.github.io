You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

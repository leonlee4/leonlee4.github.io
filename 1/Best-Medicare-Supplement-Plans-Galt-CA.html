<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

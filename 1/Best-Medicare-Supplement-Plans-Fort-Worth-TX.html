<h2>Medicare Vs Medicaid in Fort Worth TX</h2>
<p>Coverage from an employer by way of the SHOP Marketplace is handled the identical as coverage from any job-based mostly health plan. If you’re getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace based mostly on your or your spouse’s present job, Medicare Secondary Payer guidelines apply. But all private plans offering prescription drug coverage, including Marketplace and SHOP plans, must report to you in writing if their prescription drug coverage is creditable every year.Learn more about creditable coverage. While prescription drug coverage is an important health benefit, prescription drug coverage in a Marketplace or SHOP health plan isn’t required to be no less than as good as Medicare Part D coverage.<p>
<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age sixty five need to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage through them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B.

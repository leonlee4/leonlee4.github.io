<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at 65 and at present have company offered group coverage, are you required to verify this with Medicare? What I am attempting to clarify is what precisely do you need to do to keep away from these penalties for not signing up you refer to. How do they confirm whether or not you could have or didn’t have a bunch health plan?<p>
